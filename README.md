This repository contains a selection of dynamic programming problems solved in Python. The focus is not on collecting many exercises, but on understanding and illustrating common dynamic programming ideas such as problem decomposition, optimal substructure, and recurrence relations.

his repository is organized into two parts:
core/
A curated selection of dynamic programming problems chosen to illustrate key patterns and ideas (state definition, recurrence relations, boundary conditions, and time–space trade-offs).
These solutions are written with an emphasis on clarity and explicit reasoning and are intended as representative examples of my approach to dynamic programming.

additional/
Additional solved problems kept for completeness and further practice.
These files are less curated and mainly serve as a personal learning record.
I worked on these problems while transitioning from a theoretical mathematics background to more algorithmic and applied settings. For each problem, I aimed to write solutions that are explicit about the underlying reasoning, boundary conditions, and time–space trade-offs, rather than overly optimized or minimal code.

The problems are chosen to represent different DP patterns (one-dimensional and multi-dimensional states, optimization vs counting, etc.). Whenever useful, short comments explain the core idea behind the solution.

This repository is intended as a personal learning record, but also as a small collection of clear, self-contained examples of structured problem solving in code.
